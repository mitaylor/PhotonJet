   A measurement of the photon-tagged jet axis decorrelation in PbPb and pp collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC is presented. The jet axis decorrelation is the angular difference between two definitions of the jet axis: the winner-take all axis, which follows the direction of leading energy flow in the jet, and the energy-weighted axis, which follows the direction of average energy flow in the jet. This quantity is sensitive to the scattering of jet constituents in the quark-gluon plasma. Events are selected with a leading isolated photon with transverse momentum between 60 - 200 GeV, as well as jets opposite in azimuthal angle from the photon and with transverse momentum between 30 - 100 GeV. Jets with transverse momentum less than 60 GeV have consistent jet axis decorrelation shapes for pp and PbPb collisions. However, jets with transverse momentum greater than 60 GeV in central PbPb collisions have narrower jet axis decorrlation distributions relative to pp collisions. The results are compared to predictions from the Jewel, Pyquen, and Hybrid theoretical models, which include different descriptions of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma.
